# Heart-Failure-Prediction
A predictive model for heart failure risk assessment using machine learning techniques.

* Created a machine learning-based heart disease prediction model with a focus on early detection, aiming to enhance patient outcomes and reduce costs. Led data collection, pre-processing, and feature selection stages, followed by careful algorithm selection, model training, and evaluation.
* The resulting model has diverse applications in healthcare, insurance, and medical research. Its robust framework contributes to health management and risk assessment, providing valuable insights for improved decision-making and resource allocation.
  
* Technology Used: Python, machine learning.
